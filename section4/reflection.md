## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I took a larger than average break after completing half of the exercises in section 4 and felt that it was really beneficial and I felt fresher while working through the second half!

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I still worked in larger nearly hour long chunks, but I found the timer helpful in making me want to close out all distractions, which helped me stay focused on the task at hand.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An Object is a data type that can contain keys that are tied to values of any other data type inside of it. It is a way to list items of importance surrounding a certain subject, even if all of those items come in many different forms. This is differing from an Array in that an array only stores values, and cannot link those values to keys.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - array - all same data type and no overarching organization needed.
  * List of states and their capitals - object - same data type, but needs to be contextualized to a country (probably)
  * List of things to pack for vacation - array - no extra context needed
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array - no extra context needed
  * List of student names and their cohort - object - more structure needed to assign students to cohorts
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - object - more structure needed to assign amounts with the corresponding ingredient
  * All my favorite restaurants - array - no extra context needed

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Email object, I wouldn't be surprised if each email sent is coded as an object with sender, recipient, has hasAttachment and more keys. The values associated with those keys would be sender : "x@y.com", recipient: "me@me.com", and the hasAttachment would be a boolean value.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

I am ready to implement as much of what I have learned into a project!
