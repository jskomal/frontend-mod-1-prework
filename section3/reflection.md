## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
"By believing that you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice"- YES! Confidence is key, and envisioning myself on the way to success is a huge step in the journey to following through.
Getting stuck is part of the process - working your way through tough concepts is also key, and will teach you significantly more about yourself than the concepts that flow easily.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I WANT to be better at coding, which drives me to learn more, read side articles, and see what fringe cases have to offer.
I can always do more, and I could ask others for help more, instead of only relying on myself.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Carts for any online shop must include a multitude of arrays.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An Array is a stored list of values which can be of the same or varying data types.  A Method is an action that can be applied to objects in javascript.
An Array method is an action that can be taken on lists, such as adding, removing, or updating an entry on said list.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is used to automate simple tasks that would be tedious but necessary.
We use loops with arrays whenever we need to apply the same treatment or action to every item in a list.
We use loops without arrays in objects when counting.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
It would take a long time to write your name 1,000,000 times, but I can tell a computer to write it that many times with only a couple of words!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I feel solid on arrays and loops, I would love to have a project to make me implement what I've learned from this instead of isolated exercises.
