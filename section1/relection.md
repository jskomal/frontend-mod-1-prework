## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?



2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
STRINGS - Think "text" - words and characters that makeup phrases to be used in the programs
NUMBERS - think "numbers" - anything that needs to be stored for pricing, math, etc
BOOLEANS - think "true/false" - anything that needs to be stored as a yes or no only

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello world!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

We use // at the beginning of a line to indicate comments
The purpose of a code comment is to clarify a coder's intent and decisions on how a code should be written.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a value (out of many different types) that must be stored for later use. I would tell a 5 year old that a variable is akin to a piece of fruit in their lunch box. Someday's it's an apple somedays it's an orange, but there's always some fruit in their lunch.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Username or email - STRINGS
Password - String (hopefully encrypted somehow)
number of notifications - number

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the joining of words and phrases. This is useful in creating phrases that have personalized content for any who looks at a site.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

Any shopping app needs to concatenate prices and tax to get you your total amount to pay.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I'm just excited to start putting it all together soon!
